# Improved Messaging & Crawler Blocking Detection

## ✅ What Was Improved

### 1. **Progress Messaging - 30 Minute Estimate**

**Before:**
```
Analyzing all pages (5-30 minutes)
```

**After:**
```
Analyzing all pages • This may take up to 30 minutes
ℹ️ You can leave this page - analysis runs in the background
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clearer expectations for users
- ✅ Informs users they can leave the page
- ✅ Reduces anxiety about long wait times

---

### 2. **Crawler Blocking Detection**

**Automatic Detection:**
```javascript
if (results.totalPages === 0 && crawl finished) {
  → Mark as 'blocked'
  → Store IP whitelist instructions
  → Show helpful error message
}
```

**When Detected:**
```json
{
  "crawl_progress": "finished",
  "pages_crawled": 0,
  "extended_crawl_status": "unknown" or "forbidden_http_header"
}
```

### 3. **IP Whitelist Instructions**

**Dashboard Display for Blocked Sites:**
