# Custom Signup Form with Auth0 Management API ✅

## What We've Implemented

### 🎨 **Custom Signup Form UI**
- **Restored the beautiful custom form** with Full Name, Business Email, and Password fields
- **Password strength indicator** with real-time validation
- **Professional styling** matching your subscription page design
- **"Start your 7-day free trial" messaging**
- **Google OAuth option** as an alternative

### 🔐 **Auth0 Management API Integration**
- **No redirects to Auth0 login page** - users stay on your site
- **Secure user creation** using Auth0 Management API
- **Password validation** handled by Auth0's security standards
- **Automatic user linking** between Auth0 and your Supabase database

### 🛡️ **Security Benefits**
- **Passwords never stored locally** - Auth0 handles all password security
- **Enterprise-grade authentication** with Auth0's infrastructure
- **Automatic password hashing** and security validation
- **User verification** and account management through Auth0

- User is redirected to subscription page

### 3. **Auth0 Integration**
